:information_source: **About this server** :information_source:  
This is a friendly community geared towards getting as many new people as possible to start raiding. 
We provide structured guidance sometimes (the School Bus), but even outside of that, everyone should be able to find a group here, regardless of experience levels. 
Enjoy and have fun!

:question: **Are you a Newbie** :question: 
If you are new to the world of raiding, check #builds-tutorials for some basic tutorials and then ask if there is a bus going in #raid-recruitment or wait around until someone hosts one. 
If no buses are starting soon, you can ask a regular group to take you along, but then it's your own job to learn the ropes for yourself. 

:question: **Are you a Veteran** :question: 
Help is always appreciated! If you meet the requirements and are cool with helping out newbies and don't mind them joining your raids, pm a moderator to get your vet role. See #info 


:bangbang: **Server Rules** :bangbang:  
:one: **Nicknaming**
please set your name so it matches your warframe IGN, or at least put the IGN in parentheses behind your name. 

:two: **Don't be a dick (bannable offense)**
It is perfectly clear what kinds of infractions this covers, and moderators will quote rule 2 when dispensing warnings and bans. 

:three: **Don't spam, don't post NSFW content or insults. (bannable offense)**
Some fucking profanity is still cool though. Either use your head or ask a mod before posting questionable content. 

:four: **Respect our team**
They are working hard to make sure you have a nice place to find raids.

:five: **No religious or political discussion in public channels EVER (bannable offense)**
If you really want to argue with someone about that, take it to private messages or find an empty voice channel!

:six: **Do your best not to discriminate against newbies in raids**
It is ok to set requirements regarding gear for TJV, and requirements regarding experience and gear for LoR NM. 

:seven: **Always use the appropriate channels**
**Read a channel's description before posting in it**. Non-warframe related stuff and memes in #offtopic, raid recruitment in #raid-recruitment, recruitment for other missions in #misc-recruitment, bot commands in #botspam.
More details in #info

:eight: **Avoid getting warnings!**
Breaking rules gets you a private warning PM, after that a public 'Warned' role and finally a kick!

:nine: **Follow the Server Etiquette**
You can find it in #info 

If you have any question, feel free to ask one of the moderators!
